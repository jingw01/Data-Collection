"Case Profile - Transatlantic Holdings, Inc. (New York Supreme Court) (Alleghany Proposed Acquisition)",Settled,"Jun 12, 2011 to Mar  6, 2012",$0,"On behalf of all holders of Transatlantic Holdings, Inc. (""Transatlantic"" or the ""Company"") common or preferred stock.","Transatlantic Holdings, Inc. (TRH)893521104","Jan 10, 2013","New York Supreme Court, New York County",N/A,"Transatlantic Holdings, Inc.;Robert F. Orlich;Michael C. Sapnar;Richard S. Press;John G. Foos;Ian H. Chippendale;John L. McCarthy;Stephen P. Bradley;Alleghany Corporation;Shoreline Merger Sub, LLC;",0,0,"The claims arise out of the Company's Board of Director's (the ""Board"" or the ""Individual Defendants"") efforts to sell Transatlantic to Alleghany Corporation (""Alleghany"") via an unfair process for stock and cash valued at approximately $3.4 billion (the ""Proposed Acquisition""). According to the complaint, under the terms of the Proposed Acquisition, each Transatlantic shareholder is to receive 0.145 Alleghany share and $14.22 in cash for each Transatlantic share they own, for a purported value of $59.79 per Transatlantic share.The complaint alleges that Defendants breached their fiduciary duties in their pursuit of a sale of the Company at an unfair price through an unfair and self-serving process to defendant Alleghany. The complaint alleges that the Board and management are solidifying their positions at the much larger post-Proposed Acquisition company as part of a Proposed Acquisition that undervalues the Company. In fact, the Proposed Acquisition only values the Company at 86% of its book value. This deep discount to the Company's book value is not a surprise given the Company's management's refusal to undertake a full, fair, and truthful sales process. The inadequate process has led to the Proposed Acquisition which fails to maximize the Company's value.The Individual Defendants botched the sale of the Company from the start. The Company initially announced that it would be acquired by Allied World Assurance Company Holdings, AG (""Allied World"") in July 2011 for only 80% of book value (the ""Allied World Proposed Acquisition.""). The Company's shareholders, however, immediately came out against the deal.While attempting to push through the acquisition by Allied World, the Company received an unsolicited higher offer from Validus Holdings, Ltd. (""Validus""). The Individual Defendants, however, never seriously considered Validus's offer. Instead, Transatlantic's Board initiated a poison-pill to prevent Validus from seeking to acquire the Company through a tender offer. Next, they sued Validus for securities violations, in an attempt to protect their favored deal with Allied World.The complaint alleges that abruptly, on September 16, 2011, Transatlantic and Allied World mutually terminated their previously announced merger agreement. Consistent with the terms of the merger agreement agreed to by the Individual Defendants, Transatlantic, and Allied World, the Company agreed to pay, within two business days, a termination fee in the amount of $35 million (and expense reimbursement in the amount of $13.3 million). The Individual Defendants also agreed to pay an additional fee in the amount of $66.7 million in the event that, prior to September 15, 2012, Transatlantic enters into any definitive agreement in respect of any competing transaction or recommends or submits a competing transaction to its stockholders for adoption, or a transaction in respect of a competing transaction is consummated. By agreeing to the Proposed Acquisition, the Individual Defendants triggered that clause. Thus, in total, by failing to appropriately shop the Company and selling it for too cheap, the Individual Defendants wasted $115 million. This $115 million is consideration that should be paid to shareholders, not Allied World.Following the failure of the Allied World Proposed Acquisition, in October 2011, the Company also received offers from at least two other companies. In total, the Company had four suitors after the announcement of the Allied World Proposed Acquisition. The Individual Defendants now claim they have received the maximum value for shareholders, but the sales process after the breakdown of the Allied World Proposed Acquisition has been as flawed as the previous sales process. Here, the Individual Defendants did not provide all the well-qualified suitors with valuable information or a level playing field. Once again, the Individual Defendants' resistance to potential suitors and rush to get a deal done has caused them to fail to maximize shareholder value.To advance its goal of securing the Propose",https://link.issgovernance.com/scas/docViewer.php?fileName=33086cmp.pdf

Defendants constructed a fraudulent scheme to represent the Company as a substantial business entity with escalating profits when it was, in fact, little more than a shell company. From 1998 through 2001, they caused ACLN to grossly misrepresent its revenues and income, fabricate an entire line of business, and claim ownership of assets that did not exist or it did not own. Falsifying its assets and results of operations allowed ACLN to obtain a listing for its stock on the Nasdaq National Market System and subsequently on the New York Stock Exchange, further bolstering the contrived picture of a successful business.",
