"Case Profile - Transatlantic Holdings, Inc. (New York Supreme Court) (Alleghany Proposed Acquisition)",Settled,"Jun 12, 2011 to Mar  6, 2012",$0,"On behalf of all holders of Transatlantic Holdings, Inc. (""Transatlantic"" or the ""Company"") common or preferred stock.","Transatlantic Holdings, Inc. (TRH)893521104","Jan 10, 2013","New York Supreme Court, New York County",N/A,"Transatlantic Holdings, Inc.;Robert F. Orlich;Michael C. Sapnar;Richard S. Press;John G. Foos;Ian H. Chippendale;John L. McCarthy;Stephen P. Bradley;Alleghany Corporation;Shoreline Merger Sub, LLC;",0,0,"The claims arise out of the Company's Board of Director's (the ""Board"" or the ""Individual Defendants"") efforts to sell Transatlantic to Alleghany Corporation (""Alleghany"") via an unfair process for stock and cash valued at approximately $3.4 billion (the ""Proposed Acquisition""). According to the complaint, under the terms of the Proposed Acquisition, each Transatlantic shareholder is to receive 0.145 Alleghany share and $14.22 in cash for each Transatlantic share they own, for a purported value of $59.79 per Transatlantic share.The complaint alleges that Defendants breached their fiduciary duties in their pursuit of a sale of the Company at an unfair price through an unfair and self-serving process to defendant Alleghany. The complaint alleges that the Board and management are solidifying their positions at the much larger post-Proposed Acquisition company as part of a Proposed Acquisition that undervalues the Company. In fact, the Proposed Acquisition only values the Company at 86% of its book value. This deep discount to the Company's book value is not a surprise given the Company's management's refusal to undertake a full, fair, and truthful sales process. The inadequate process has led to the Proposed Acquisition which fails to maximize the Company's value.The Individual Defendants botched the sale of the Company from the start. The Company initially announced that it would be acquired by Allied World Assurance Company Holdings, AG (""Allied World"") in July 2011 for only 80% of book value (the ""Allied World Proposed Acquisition.""). The Company's shareholders, however, immediately came out against the deal.While attempting to push through the acquisition by Allied World, the Company received an unsolicited higher offer from Validus Holdings, Ltd. (""Validus""). The Individual Defendants, however, never seriously considered Validus's offer. Instead, Transatlantic's Board initiated a poison-pill to prevent Validus from seeking to acquire the Company through a tender offer. Next, they sued Validus for securities violations, in an attempt to protect their favored deal with Allied World.The complaint alleges that abruptly, on September 16, 2011, Transatlantic and Allied World mutually terminated their previously announced merger agreement. Consistent with the terms of the merger agreement agreed to by the Individual Defendants, Transatlantic, and Allied World, the Company agreed to pay, within two business days, a termination fee in the amount of $35 million (and expense reimbursement in the amount of $13.3 million). The Individual Defendants also agreed to pay an additional fee in the amount of $66.7 million in the event that, prior to September 15, 2012, Transatlantic enters into any definitive agreement in respect of any competing transaction or recommends or submits a competing transaction to its stockholders for adoption, or a transaction in respect of a competing transaction is consummated. By agreeing to the Proposed Acquisition, the Individual Defendants triggered that clause. Thus, in total, by failing to appropriately shop the Company and selling it for too cheap, the Individual Defendants wasted $115 million. This $115 million is consideration that should be paid to shareholders, not Allied World.Following the failure of the Allied World Proposed Acquisition, in October 2011, the Company also received offers from at least two other companies. In total, the Company had four suitors after the announcement of the Allied World Proposed Acquisition. The Individual Defendants now claim they have received the maximum value for shareholders, but the sales process after the breakdown of the Allied World Proposed Acquisition has been as flawed as the previous sales process. Here, the Individual Defendants did not provide all the well-qualified suitors with valuable information or a level playing field. Once again, the Individual Defendants' resistance to potential suitors and rush to get a deal done has caused them to fail to maximize shareholder value.To advance its goal of securing the Propose",https://link.issgovernance.com/scas/docViewer.php?fileName=33086cmp.pdf

The Proposed Transaction is valued at approximately $253 million.Among other things, the complaint alleges that the Merger Agreement gives Merz access to any rival bidder's information and allows Merz a free right to top any superior offer. Accordingly, no rival bidder is likely to emerge and act as a stalking horse for Merz, because the Merger Agreement unfairly assures that any ""auction"" will favor Merz and piggy-back upon the due diligence of the foreclosed second bidder.The complaint further alleges that despite their duty to maximize shareholder value, the Defendants have clear and material conflicts of interest and are acting to better their own interests at the expense of BioForm's public shareholders. For example, certain of the Company's directors and officers hold unvested stock options that will automatically vest upon consummation of the Proposed Transaction. Upon consummation of the Proposed Transaction, the directors and officers will receive an aggregate value equal to $7,787,626 by cashing out these previously unvested stock options.Case Notes:A class was certified in this action on April 4, 2012.

Steven Geis;Carrie Cox;Pfizer, Inc.;",0,1,"The Complaint alleges as follows: Pharmacia marketed Celebrex as a new type of drug that, unlike aspirin or ibuprofen, retarded pain and inflammation without the adverse side effects of ulcers or gastrointestinal bleeding.During the Class Period, Pharmacia and its partner Pfizer, who funded the study, trumpeted the results of the ""Celecoxib Long-term Arthritis Safety Study"" (the ""CLASS"" study) -- a clinical study to compare the gastrointestinal problems of patients who used Celebrex to those of patients who used other Nonsteroidal Anti-inflammatory Drugs (""NSAIDs) -- which found that Celebrex caused fewer gastrointestinal problems than traditional drugs, such as ibuprofen.Given all the hype surrounding the CLASS study, the Journal of the American Medical Association (""JAMA"") published a study by the Company that showed that Celebrex caused fewer gastrointestinal problems than traditional drugs. Unbeknownst, however, to JAMA, the study was flawed because the Company manipulated the results in such a way to show that Celebrex was safer for the stomach and digestive tract than conventional drugs by not including in the final analysis all of the data collected through the entire duration of the study, which concluded opposite to the Company's findings. During the Class Period, the Company failed to make adequate disclosures concerning this study and used this fallacious study in their continuing efforts to have the Food and Drug Administration remove the warning label from Celebrex. During the Class Period, the Company continued to misrepresent that Celebrex was just as likely to cause ulcers like older, cheaper medicines until an August 22, 2001 report in The Wall Street Journal shed light on the Company's fallacious misrepresentations.On August 22, 2001, The Wall Street Journal (""The Journal"") reported that reviews, conducted by researchers from the Cleveland Clinic, of clinical trials for the arthritis drug Celebrex indicated that the medication might carry an increased risk for cardiovascular events. They concluded that heart- attack rates with Celebrex were high enough to be a concern. The researchers concluded: ""Given the remarkable exposure and popularity of this new class of medications, we believe that it is mandatory to conduct a trial specifically assessing cardiovascular risk and benefit of these agents. Until then, we urge caution in prescribing these agents to patients at risk for cardiovascular morbidity.""

(""Washington Mutual""), the parent company of WMAAC, was among the nation's largest savings and loan institutions, ranking in the top ten of all US.-based bank and thrift holding companies based on consolidated assets. Washington Mutual was also one of the nation's largest home loan originators, having originated more than $200 billion in home loans in fiscal 2006.Washington Mutual filed a voluntary petition for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on September 26, 2008. Because of this bankruptcy filing, Washington Mutual is not named as a defendant. WMAAC pooled together many of the loans Washington Mutual originated in 2006 and securitized them into mortgage backed securities that were sold to qualifying special-purpose entities, in this case referred to as the ""Issuing Trusts"". The Issuing Trusts, in turn, sold ""Certificates"" to Plaintiffs and other members of the Class during the Class Period, providing monthly distributions of interest and principal on future cash flows from the mortgages underlying the Issuing Trusts. As borrowers paid their mortgages, distributions were made to the Plaintiffs and members of the Class. WMAAC was the ""Depositor"" in the securitization transactions, and was the ""Issuer"" of the Certificates within the meaning of the Securities Act.The Registration Statement repeatedly touted the supposedly strong underwriting standards employed by Washington Mutual, as originator of many of the mortgages underlying the Issuing Trusts, to assure Plaintiffs and other Class members that Washington Mutual issued mortgages only after the real-estate that collateralized the loans had been subjected to objective and independent real-estate appraisals that met the standards of the Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice (""USPAP"").In this regard, the Registration Statement included numerous representations about the quality of the mortgage pools underlying the Issuing Trust, such as the loan-to-value (""LTV') ratios used to qualify borrowers and the appraisal standards against which the real- estate that collateralized the mortgages had been valued. These representations were repeated in and incorporated into prospectuses and supplemental prospectuses that WMAAC filed with the SEC in connection with the sale of Certificates to Plaintiffs and members of the Class.Based in part on these representations, WMAAC obtained credit ratings for each of the Certificates issued by the Issuing Trusts, and representations about these credit ratings, were included in the supplemental prospectuses filed with the SEC in connection with the sale of the Certificates. All of this information was essential in valuing the investment quality of the Certificates.  As it has now become known, throughout the Class Period, Washington Mutual had systematically inflated the appraised values of the properties that secured the mortgages. By inflating the appraised values, Washington Mutual was able to close more loans and earn more comprised the Issuing Trusts were not originated in accordance with the stated underwriting fees by issuing mortgages to unqualified borrowers. Then by pooling and selling those mortgages to the Issuing Trusts, Washington Mutual and WMAAC shifted the undisclosed and increased risk of loss from mortgage defaults to Plaintiffs and other unwitting Class members.The scheme was ultimately unraveled in a complaint that New York Attorney General Andrew Cuomo (the '""NYAG"") filed on November 1, 2007), which cited emails showing how Washington Mutual had improperly pressured supposedly, independent appraisers to artificially inflate real-estate appraisals in order to close home loans that would otherwise not have closed because, absent the inflated values, the LTV ratio would be too high for the borrowers to qualify.Contrary to the material assurances in the Registration Statement, mortgages that Washington Mutual improperly caused its employees to inflate appraisals, and as the NYAG alleged, following the retention of out",https://link.issgovernance.com/scas/docViewer.php?fileName=30908cmp.pdf
