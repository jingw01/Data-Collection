"Case Profile - Transatlantic Holdings, Inc. (New York Supreme Court) (Alleghany Proposed Acquisition)",Settled,"Jun 12, 2011 to Mar  6, 2012",$0,"On behalf of all holders of Transatlantic Holdings, Inc. (""Transatlantic"" or the ""Company"") common or preferred stock.","Transatlantic Holdings, Inc. (TRH)893521104","Jan 10, 2013","New York Supreme Court, New York County",N/A,"Transatlantic Holdings, Inc.;Robert F. Orlich;Michael C. Sapnar;Richard S. Press;John G. Foos;Ian H. Chippendale;John L. McCarthy;Stephen P. Bradley;Alleghany Corporation;Shoreline Merger Sub, LLC;",0,0,"The claims arise out of the Company's Board of Director's (the ""Board"" or the ""Individual Defendants"") efforts to sell Transatlantic to Alleghany Corporation (""Alleghany"") via an unfair process for stock and cash valued at approximately $3.4 billion (the ""Proposed Acquisition""). According to the complaint, under the terms of the Proposed Acquisition, each Transatlantic shareholder is to receive 0.145 Alleghany share and $14.22 in cash for each Transatlantic share they own, for a purported value of $59.79 per Transatlantic share.The complaint alleges that Defendants breached their fiduciary duties in their pursuit of a sale of the Company at an unfair price through an unfair and self-serving process to defendant Alleghany. The complaint alleges that the Board and management are solidifying their positions at the much larger post-Proposed Acquisition company as part of a Proposed Acquisition that undervalues the Company. In fact, the Proposed Acquisition only values the Company at 86% of its book value. This deep discount to the Company's book value is not a surprise given the Company's management's refusal to undertake a full, fair, and truthful sales process. The inadequate process has led to the Proposed Acquisition which fails to maximize the Company's value.The Individual Defendants botched the sale of the Company from the start. The Company initially announced that it would be acquired by Allied World Assurance Company Holdings, AG (""Allied World"") in July 2011 for only 80% of book value (the ""Allied World Proposed Acquisition.""). The Company's shareholders, however, immediately came out against the deal.While attempting to push through the acquisition by Allied World, the Company received an unsolicited higher offer from Validus Holdings, Ltd. (""Validus""). The Individual Defendants, however, never seriously considered Validus's offer. Instead, Transatlantic's Board initiated a poison-pill to prevent Validus from seeking to acquire the Company through a tender offer. Next, they sued Validus for securities violations, in an attempt to protect their favored deal with Allied World.The complaint alleges that abruptly, on September 16, 2011, Transatlantic and Allied World mutually terminated their previously announced merger agreement. Consistent with the terms of the merger agreement agreed to by the Individual Defendants, Transatlantic, and Allied World, the Company agreed to pay, within two business days, a termination fee in the amount of $35 million (and expense reimbursement in the amount of $13.3 million). The Individual Defendants also agreed to pay an additional fee in the amount of $66.7 million in the event that, prior to September 15, 2012, Transatlantic enters into any definitive agreement in respect of any competing transaction or recommends or submits a competing transaction to its stockholders for adoption, or a transaction in respect of a competing transaction is consummated. By agreeing to the Proposed Acquisition, the Individual Defendants triggered that clause. Thus, in total, by failing to appropriately shop the Company and selling it for too cheap, the Individual Defendants wasted $115 million. This $115 million is consideration that should be paid to shareholders, not Allied World.Following the failure of the Allied World Proposed Acquisition, in October 2011, the Company also received offers from at least two other companies. In total, the Company had four suitors after the announcement of the Allied World Proposed Acquisition. The Individual Defendants now claim they have received the maximum value for shareholders, but the sales process after the breakdown of the Allied World Proposed Acquisition has been as flawed as the previous sales process. Here, the Individual Defendants did not provide all the well-qualified suitors with valuable information or a level playing field. Once again, the Individual Defendants' resistance to potential suitors and rush to get a deal done has caused them to fail to maximize shareholder value.To advance its goal of securing the Propose"

From the outset, the Board immediately locked in on a sale of the Company to Markel and never considered, much less explored, other strategic opportunities, such as remaining a standalone company or a sale to another bidder. In fact, the Board did not take any steps to gauge third-party interest; it neither conducted a market check nor even approached a single party other than Markel about a potential transaction before agreeing to the merger. The failure to conduct even a pro forma pre-signing market check is even more egregious in light of the Board's agreement to a no-solicitation provision in the Agreement and Plan of Merger dated December 18, 2012 that has precluded them from contacting any parties post-signing."

However, these contracts violated Company policy in that they were far larger than necessary to hedge normal business operations. As a result of Aracruz's clandestine and speculative currency wagers, credit rating agencies downgraded Aracruz, the Company's CFO resigned, and Aracruz's stock suffered a severe decline, plummeting to the lowest levels in 14 years. On October 3, 2008, the price of the ADR's traded on the New York Stock Exchange closed at $23.40, down $7.84 per share, a decline of 25%.

In order to consummate the transaction -- which required the approval of BoA shareholders -- BoA and Merrill Lynch issued a joint proxy statement dated October 31, 2008 (the ""Proxy Statement"") to the shareholders of BoA soliciting their approval for and recommending a vote in favor of the Acquisition.The Complaint alleges that the Proxy Statement contained numerous material misstatements and omissions. In particular, the Proxy Statement did not accurately disclose Merrill Lynch's financial condition and did not disclose the significant risks and liabilities that BoA and its shareholders would be assuming by acquiring Merrill Lynch. Nor did the Proxy Statement reveal that BoA and its advisors had not conducted adequate diligence on Merrill Lynch and that, as a result, they lacked a reasonable basis for the recommendations and other statements set forth in the Proxy Statement.As a result of the material misstatements and omissions contained in the Proxy Statement, the Acquisition was overwhelmingly approved, with 82% of votes cast in favor of the transaction.Also, on January 1, 2009, the date the Acquisition closed, BoA issued a press release announcing the Acquisition's completion. The press release contained numerous positive statements concerning the Acquisition and the joined companies, announcing the ""creat[ion of] a premier financial services franchise with significantly enhanced wealth management, investment banking and international capabilities."" As alleged in the Complaint, these statements were materially false and misleading when made in that they did not reveal that Merrill Lynch's financial condition was in such a deteriorated state that BoA had considered withdrawing from the Acquisition prior to closing and, in fact, only completed the transaction because the federal government had undertaken to assist BoA to absorb the acquisition of Merrill Lynch by, among other things, engaging in a dilutive purchase of additional BoA shares.Investors began to learn the true nature of the financial condition of BoA and the disastrous effect the Acquisition had on its financial position through a series of disclosures, including BoA's January 16, 2009 announcement of a loss for the fourth quarter of $1.79 billion, which was led by a stunning $15.31 billion fourth quarter net loss at Merrill Lynch. These revelations and others caused the price of BoA stock to tumble, from a closing price of $10.20 per share on January 14, 2009 to close at $5.10 per share on January 20, 2009, a 50% decline.Case Updates:On August 27, 2010, the Court granted in part and denied in part defendants' motion to dismiss the securities class action complaint.
