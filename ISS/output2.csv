Defendants constructed a fraudulent scheme to represent the Company as a substantial business entity with escalating profits when it was, in fact, little more than a shell company. From 1998 through 2001, they caused ACLN to grossly misrepresent its revenues and income, fabricate an entire line of business, and claim ownership of assets that did not exist or it did not own. Falsifying its assets and results of operations allowed ACLN to obtain a listing for its stock on the Nasdaq National Market System and subsequently on the New York Stock Exchange, further bolstering the contrived picture of a successful business.",
