A collection of codes to read/scrap data automatically

HTMRead - 

850 htm files saved in various folders need to be read in SAS. In each file, there are at least 400 tables that are not saved
in htm format. The purpose of this code is to scrape data of each table of a file and merge them into one csv file.
